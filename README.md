## This is only a stream of consciousness, needs to be refined. 

A site documenting common BI steps at a conceptual level and individual tools

People often ask how I know every tool, and I don't. I know the underlying concepts and then figure out how to apply them. 

Structure of Content
Explain concept generally - use visuals and diagrams
Use same sample data consistently across all examples (if possible)
Tool how-to
Show guided example 
Provide link to official documentation if available
Use consistent steps and terminology - explain where terms are different across tools

Presentation of Content
Start w/ Markdown in GitHub repo - Folders by topic
Use mermaid for diagrams
Use screenshots saved in static folders organized in a thoughtful way
State versions of software used in examples

Tools
Excel
Power BI Desktop
Tableau Public
KNIME AP
Python
R Studio
SQL

Collaboration
Build with collaboration in mind. Setup repo to accept PR's from others for new tools or better documentation of existing.
